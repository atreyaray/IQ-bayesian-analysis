# Bayesian analysis of trends in IQ test scores over successive generations

**Abstract**: 
In this report we will attempt to replicate the Flynn effect with our data and to explore the dependency between IQ change and change in
average years of schooling in the population. We will explore these dependencies both globally and per continent. 

The trend in IQ will be validated with a model that explores temporal dependency alone and a further model that factors in schooling level. We will model the data with a pooled, separate and hierarchical model. The models will explore the relationship between the passage of time and the development of IQ scores from the start of testing and the relationship between schooling level and the development of IQ scores from the start of testing.
