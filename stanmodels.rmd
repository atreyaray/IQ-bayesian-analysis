## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(rstan)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
data <- read.csv("data/preprocessed_data.csv")
data
```

```{r}
x1 <- data[,'Continent']
x2 <- data[, 'Fullscale_IQ_Change']
x3 <- data[,'Schooling_Index']

IQ <- list(N = length(x3), y = x3)
fit <- stan(file = 'pool.stan', data = IQ)
```
```{r}
ans <- extract(fit)
ans
```
