# Introduction describing
+ the motivation (these are temporary titles)

WHAT IS IQ? IQ IS... 


[@AHDI_paper]

Validate the Flynn effect and look for explanation

+ the problem

+ the main modeling idea

In this report we will attempt to replicate the Flynn effect with our given data and find
some explanatory dependencies beyond just temporal progress. We will explore these dependencies
both globally and per continent.

+ showing some illustrative figure
**just plot the data as different colored points per regions?**

# Description of the data and the analysis problem
+ Provide information where the data was obtained
The IQ data for ... IQ change between ... and ... was acquired from 
+ Where has the data previously used and how does our analysis differ
The IQ data has previously been used in a frequentist meta-analysis which gathered global historical IQ data from 1909 to 2013 and found global non-linear increases across all IQ domains. Best explanation for IQ increases was found in increasing nutrition, education and lower family size. [@IQ_Pietschnig].

Our analysis differs in that it is bayesian and studies the relationship between education level and IQ directly. This approach is vulnerable to overfitting assuming education level is determined by for example income level but this is not a concern for us as we are interested in the link between education level and IQ increase specifically.

The education level data has been analysed before with a trend analysis from 1870 onwards discovering gains globally that do not match global wealth distribution such that the global middle class has seen the best gains overall. [@AHDI_paper].

Our analysis is bayesian and concerned with the link to IQ which has not previously been explored for this data set.
