# Introduction
+ the motivation (these are temporary titles)

**(temp.) WHAT IS IQ?**
IQ is a psychometric measurement intended to measure the test taker's cognitive 
ability. IQ is by convention normally distributed with a mean of 100 points and 
a standard deviation of 15 points. Full-scale IQ is an IQ score derived by 
averaging over the results of a test battery of several subtests which are 
intended to measure different intelligence domains. IQ tests are not practiced 
for and as such are supposed to measure some inherent feature of the test taker.
IQ as a metric has been widely criticized, due to its spurious relation to an 
ordinary language understanding of intelligence and historically grave misuse of
results, but remains in wide use. The observed global trend of the average IQ to
rise over generations has been termed the Flynn effect. [@IQ_paper]. This report
does not assume any position on the validity of IQ as a metric.

+ the problem

+ the main modeling idea

In this report we will attempt to replicate the Flynn effect with our data and to
explore the dependency between IQ change and change in average years of schooling
in the population [@AHDI_paper]. We will explore these dependencies both globally
and per continent. The trend in IQ will be validated with a model that explores
temporal dependency alone and a further model that factors in schooling level.
We will model the data with a pooled and a hierarchical model**???**.

+ showing some illustrative figure
**just plot the data as different colored points per regions?**
**regression lines for each region on the same graph?**

# Data description
+ Provide information where the data was obtained
The IQ data for ... Full-scale IQ change between ... and ... was acquired from 
+ Where has the data previously used and how does our analysis differ
The Full-scale IQ data has previously been used in a frequentist meta-analysis which gathered global historical IQ data from 1909 to 2013 and found global non-linear increases across all IQ domains. Best explanation for IQ increases was found in increasing nutrition, education and lower family size. [@IQ_paper].

Our analysis differs in that it is bayesian and studies the relationship between education level and IQ directly. This approach is vulnerable to overfitting assuming education level is determined by for example income level but this is not a concern for us as we are interested in the link between education level and IQ increase specifically.

The education level data has been analysed before with a trend analysis from 1870 onwards discovering gains globally that do not match global wealth distribution such that the global middle class has seen the best gains overall. [@AHDI_paper].

Our analysis is bayesian and concerned with the link to IQ which has not previously been explored for this data set.

# Model description

The pooled model will pool all results into a global pool for which we will
simulate the following models
\begin{align*}
  &1: IQ \sim N(\alpha + \beta \cdot \text{decade}, \sigma)\\
  &2: IQ \sim N(\alpha + \beta \cdot \text{decade} + \gamma \cdot \text{schooling level}, \sigma)\\
\end{align*}
with weakly informative priors such that
\begin{align*}
  \alpha ~ N(0, 100)\\
  \beta ~ N(0, 100)\\
  \sigma ~ \mathrm{Inv-}\chi^2(1)\\
\end{align*}
These priors are based on our prior beliefs that **OUR PRIOR BELIEFS**
PRIOR BELIEFS: WE DONT EXPECT VERY EXTREME RESULTS I.E. AN IQ INCREASE ABOVE 2 STANDARD DEVIATIONS WOULD BE TOO EXTREME? WHAT IS AN IQ POINT AMONUT FOR 2 STANDARD DEVIATONS THEN? OR SOMETHING LIKE THIS????.THE INTERCEPT WOULD BE representative of???

+ hierarchical model
+ both for both year and education index
